# Project setup

steps:
1. create empty directory (mkdir project-name)
2. cd project-name
3. create index.html file (touch index.html)
4. create src directory (mkdir src)
5. import global css file in index.html
6. link fontawesome cdn
7. initialize npm (npm init -y)
8. install tailwindcss (npm install tailwindcss)(version 4)
9. setup tailwindcss
10. intialized git (git init) and track all files (git add .)


# Project Overview

This project is a web development setup guide designed to help developers quickly and efficiently create a new project using modern tools and best practices. The guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up a new project directory, create essential files, and configure necessary tools and libraries. The primary focus is on setting up a project with Tailwind CSS, a popular utility-first CSS framework, and integrating it with other tools like FontAwesome for icons and npm for package management.

## Project Setup

The setup process begins by creating an empty directory for the project using the `mkdir` command. This directory will serve as the root folder for all project files. After navigating into the newly created directory with the `cd` command, the next step is to create an `index.html` file using the `touch` command. This file will be the main entry point for the web application.

Next, a `src` directory is created to organize the source files of the project. This directory will contain all the CSS, JavaScript, and other assets required for the project. The `index.html` file is then updated to import a global CSS file and link the FontAwesome CDN for icon usage. FontAwesome is a widely-used icon library that provides a vast collection of icons for various purposes.

The project is then initialized with npm, the Node.js package manager, using the `npm init -y` command. This command creates a `package.json` file with default settings, which will be used to manage the project's dependencies. Tailwind CSS is installed as a dependency using the `npm install tailwindcss` command. Tailwind CSS version 4 is specified to ensure compatibility with the project's requirements.

After installing Tailwind CSS, the next step is to set it up by creating a configuration file and integrating it with the project's build process. This setup allows developers to use Tailwind's utility classes in their HTML files to style the application quickly and efficiently.

Finally, the project is initialized with Git, a version control system, using the `git init` command. All files are tracked using the `git add .` command, which stages all changes for the initial commit. This step ensures that the project's history is tracked from the beginning, allowing for easy collaboration and version management.

## Conclusion

This project setup guide provides a comprehensive and straightforward approach to starting a new web development project. By following these steps, developers can quickly create a new project with a well-organized structure, modern tools, and best practices. The integration of Tailwind CSS and FontAwesome ensures that the project has a solid foundation for building responsive and visually appealing web applications. Additionally, the use of npm and Git streamlines dependency management and version control, making it easier to maintain and collaborate on the project.
